# ship speed = engine[macro]thrust@forward * number-of-engines / drag@forward
# ship boost speed = ship speed * engine[macro]boost@thrust
# ship travel speed = ship speed * engine[macro]travel@thrust
# 
# boost duration = number of seconds it would take to deplete shields from 100% to 0% while boosting 
# (ie bigger value will allow longer boost and lower the speed at which shields are depleted, 0 value seems to get boost stuck indefinitely)
# boost/travel attack = number of seconds for max thrust to be achieved (ie lower attack value = faster acceleration in boost and travel)
# release delay = number of seconds before travel/boost hits reverse to normal speed?
