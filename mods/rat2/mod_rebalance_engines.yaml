# increase boost duration, especially for travel engines so stupid AI doesn't burn through them as easily
# increase performance of engines for large ships:
# increased boost speed for L/XL so boost is now more useful and so AI hopefully has a chance to get away from an attack and not get stuck boosting endlessly
# decreased boost speed for M/S to balance increasing boost time
# increased travel performance to make other races more competitive with Terrans
